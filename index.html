  <h1>Want to earn cash?</h1>
  <p>I know of a site that allows you to earn cash by sharing links to other webpages through a url shortener. For example, if you clicked
    the button above that says "Get Free BTC" you would've been taken to a page that would click through to the next page that I intended for 
    you to go to. If you have your own webpage you can use this service to earn money by having your viewers follow the link through the URL 
    shortener. Click the button below to register with this service in order to earn cash.</p>
